# Quiz Application

This is a simple **Quiz Application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app dynamically presents multiple-choice questions, evaluates user responses, and provides feedback by changing the color of the selected answer (green for correct, red for incorrect). After answering each question, users can proceed to the next one, and at the end, they can see their final score.

### Features:
- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Each question has four possible answers, and only one is correct.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: 
  - If the answer is correct, the button turns **green**.
  - If the answer is incorrect, the button turns **red** while also highlighting the correct answer in green.
- **Next Button Functionality**: After answering, users can click the **Next** button to move to the next question.
- **Score Display**: At the end of the quiz, the userâ€™s total score is displayed, showing how many correct answers they gave out of the total number of questions.
- **Restart Quiz**: Once the quiz is completed, users can restart it from the beginning.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structuring the page layout for the quiz interface.
- **CSS**: Styling the quiz, including hover effects and dynamic coloring for correct and incorrect answers.
- **JavaScript**: Handling the quiz logic, including presenting questions, evaluating answers, providing feedback, and calculating the final score.
